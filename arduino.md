### Arduino

#### Setup
* Download Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software  

#### Verify setup
Verify that the Arduino is setup properly by loading a sample program onto it:
*  Connect the Arduino to your computer, then in the Arduino IDE, click on file->examples->01.basics->Blink.  
* This will open a simple program in a new window.  Click on the sketch menu and click upload.  This should upload a program that will blink the onboard LED every 1 second.  
* Try changing the program so it blinks every 5 seconds, and re-upload

#### Program

Follow [this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-2-leds/blinking-the-led) to build a basic circuit with an LED.  Ignore any reference to resistors, since we didn't provide you with any.  Using this as a starting point, try to incorporate the sensor and turn the LED on/off based on sensor activity
